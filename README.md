This is a Vending Machine that allows people to buy Products by entering the Item Code and 
inserting the money required for that Item
```

### Lists of Items in the Vending Machine

|Item Code | Item             | Cost  |
| -------- | ---------------- | ----- | 
| A1       | Cookie           | 100   |
| A2       | iPhone Charger   | 1500  |
| C5       | Potato Chips     | 200   |
| D4       | Chewing Gum      | 150   |

## Approach 
To program a VendingMachine you would need to write few methods which you will be using it
In this Program I used the following methods 
1. ListMenu     - For listing the Items and their Itemcode
2. getItemPrice - For getting the price for each Items
3. addMoney     - For adding the money
4. buy          - For buying the product or item 
5. End          - Finally press 4. to end the Program

And there are certain conditions which you need to use such as when
* If you haven't added enough money for the Item then you need to add
- And after each succesful vend you need to display "Vend Succesful"
+ And if you have added more money you should return back the Balance 
* If the item code isn't valid or isn't available you need to display - "Item Invalid"
